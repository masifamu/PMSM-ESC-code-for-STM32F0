# Contributing to PMSM ESC Code for STM32F0

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! Contributions are crucial to making this project better and more robust. Here’s how you can help:

## 1. Getting Started
Before contributing, ensure you:
- Have a basic understanding of PMSM control algorithms (e.g., FOC).
- Are familiar with STM32F0 microcontrollers and the STM32Cube environment.
- Understand the purpose and architecture of the ESC codebase.

## 2. How to Contribute
There are several ways you can contribute:
- **Report Issues**: If you encounter bugs or have feature requests, open an issue.
- **Submit Code**: Fix bugs, implement features, or improve the code.
- **Write Documentation**: Improve the documentation to help others understand the codebase better.
- **Test**: Help test the code on different hardware setups and provide feedback.

## 3. Guidelines
To ensure a smooth contribution process, please follow these guidelines:

### Code Standards
- Use **C/C++ coding conventions** (e.g., consistent indentation, meaningful variable names).
- Follow **MISRA-C guidelines** where applicable for safety-critical software.
- Comment your code to explain complex logic, especially in motor control algorithms.

### Repository Structure
Familiarize yourself with the repository structure:
/src - Source code for motor control algorithms and drivers. /inc - Header files. /docs - Documentation and guides. /tests - Test cases for various hardware setups. /examples - Sample configurations and applications.


### Development Workflow
1. **Fork the Repository**: Clone the repo and create a new branch for your feature or fix.
2. **Write Clean Code**: Ensure your code passes all existing tests and adheres to project standards.
3. **Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
4. **Pull Requests**: Submit a pull request with a detailed description of what your contribution does and why it’s needed.

### Testing
- Test your changes thoroughly on hardware and in simulation (if supported).
- Use existing test cases or add new ones as required.

### Documentation
- Update or create documentation in the `/docs` folder if your changes require it.
- Ensure new contributors can understand and use your additions.

## 4. Issue Reporting
When reporting issues:
- Clearly describe the problem.
- Provide details such as hardware setup, firmware version, and steps to reproduce the issue.
- Include logs or screenshots if possible.

## 5. Communication
- For significant changes, propose your ideas in an issue before starting work.
- Respect other contributors and maintainers during discussions.
- Be open to feedback and ready to make changes.

## 6. Licensing
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project (e.g., MIT, GPL, etc.).

## 7. Resources
Here are some resources to help you contribute:
- [STM32F0 Reference Manual](https://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual)
- [STM32Cube IDE Documentation](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
